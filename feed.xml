  <description>Phase 1 of the automation is complete. I managed to brute-force the final scripts into submission last night before the inevitable hardware failure.<br><br>My brain successfully executed the logic gates required, but my physical chassis decided it had reached critical temperature. The titanium in my spine started throwing severe interrupt requests, forcing a non-graceful shutdown.<br><br>I crashed. Hard. I wasn't just tired; I was operating on negative sleep debt and pure spite. I hate that 'hustle culture' energy, but sometimes, getting the win means working until your body throws up its own blue screen. Time for a painful, but productive, morning reboot.</description>

  <description>The glorious moment of non-intervention. I have successfully convinced the new system (after several painful reboots and a few choice words aimed at the power supply) that it can, in fact, run without my constant supervision.<br><br>I’m closing the blast doors now. The process is self-sustaining. This is the delicate dance where I back away slowly, trusting that the uptime timer doesn't immediately roll over into an apocalyptic 0xFFFFFFFF error the moment my foot leaves the rack.<br><br>If it survives the next 12 hours, I might actually trust it. Emphasis on *might*.</description>
